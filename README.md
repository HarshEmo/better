# Better

Welcome to Better, An android application, where users can make a report (post) like potholes on road, garbage mismanagement, flooded roads,corruption faced, etc and view, like, and comment on similar reports(posts) as well.
There are several features that make this app very unique and highly practial and scalable and aims to make the world a **better** place, so is its name.

## Features

### Machine Learning
The app uses different Machine learning models to give a machine level validation to each individual reports. Curently the application has 3 deep learning models within the app profiding validation(confidence ) which I have explained in much details later in this.
These help classify the important/alarming reports to seek better attentions.

### Location
While posting a report the application takes the cordinates of the report as well as a picture. The cordinates are synced on a map for reports like potholes and flooded roads which can help avoiding unfortunated circumstances.

### Val Points
Every post has cordinates and post type associated with it , which can be observed by a machine
